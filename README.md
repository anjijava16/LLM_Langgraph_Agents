# LLM_Langgraph_Agents
# Langgraph:
1. LangGraph is an orchestration framework for complex agentic systems and is more low-level and controllable than LangChain agents. On the other hand, LangChain provides a standard interface to interact with models and other components, useful for straight-forward chains and retrieval flows.
2. LangGraph is a stateful, orchestration framework that brings added control to agent workflows.
3. Development: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source building blocks, components, and third-party integrations. Use LangGraph to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.
4. Production: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
5. Deployment: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Cloud.
